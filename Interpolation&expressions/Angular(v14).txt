BrowserModule : this is telling the angualr complier that we want to use the web platform

export : it is allowing us to reference this AppModule in another file

This is called the TypeScript decorator, A decorator simply adds metadata or can say further information to a particular class
or property such as this

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})

export class AppModule {}

here Angular is going to bind this further information to this class (AppModule)

selector : this tells angualr what's the element name is going to be coz angualr is all about creating your own custom components and
giving them a unique name

Lec : 05-interpolation-and-expressions

When our component get mounted our ngOnInit() is going to get called and it does get called after our constructor is actually
instantiated and this is the hook where then Angular invokes

 message!: string;
 coz we're not using a constructor we want to use exclamation mark this tells TypeScript I'm later assign the message and is definitely
 going to available

 Interpolation allows us to evaluate variable,  a piece of data, any kinda value and print out for the user
 
An expressions is a simple way the way we can pass in something that we want to check 

? : //This is inline if statement
