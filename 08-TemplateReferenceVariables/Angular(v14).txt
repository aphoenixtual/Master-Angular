Lec : 1

TypeScript : which is a project created and managed by microsoft to bring static type benefits to js code,
Basically it is a Javascript with few superpowers

RxJS : Reactive extensions for Javascript

Angular CLI : Command line interface

Lec : 04-understand-angular-bootstrapping

BrowserModule : this is telling the angular complier that we want to use the web platform

export : it is allowing us to reference this AppModule in another file

This is called the TypeScript decorator, A decorator simply adds metadata or can say further information to a particular class
or property such as this

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})

export class AppModule {}

here Angular is going to bind this further information to this class (AppModule)

selector : this tells angular what's the element name is going to be coz angular is all about creating your own custom components and
giving them a unique name

Lec : 05-interpolation-and-expressions

{{ }} this curly brackets interpolation syntax is essentially sugar syntax 
this is a nicer way to display values by not binding to a property directly

When our component get mounted our ngOnInit() is going to get called and it does get called after our constructor is actually
instantiated and this is the hook where then Angular invokes

 message!: string;
 coz we're not using a constructor we want to use exclamation mark this tells TypeScript I'm later assign the message and is definitely
 going to available

 Interpolation allows us to evaluate variable,  a piece of data, any kinda value and print out for the user
 
An expressions is a simple way the way we can pass in something that we want to check 

? : //This is inline if statement 

Lec : 06-property-binding-syntax

In Browser console inspect there are many js property by 

document.body : it return us a reference to a document body 
document.body.innerHTML : it returns all of the source code that angular generating 

This is important coz this is the first step for One Way Data Flow 

document.body.innerText : this is calling a js getter that gives us a value from logs out

When we want to display values in a form or in a input or disabled a particular button then we need property binding 
it's important to understand property binding coz of that our components communicate 
when we talk about property binding we only need to think about One Way Data Flow


<input value="message"> this is plain html string
<input [value]="message"> here we're telling angular we need to bind a variable by providing square brackets
This is the property binding syntax along side our custom components

if we don't provide the square brackets then our variable message inside our component is never treated as some live data in Angular

Lec : 07-event-binding-syntax

Till now we've learnt how to set data by one way binding syntax to a property

Now we'll learn how to get data such as user action eg by click of a button like anything that user can perform by UI 

How to bind an event in the same way to a plain JS like element.addeventlistener passing something like click, submit, input or change 
we can do exact same in Angular 
much like we've bind a property we want talk to we also bind the event we want to talk to

$event : It is a object (by dollar $ it is just a angular way of asking for a object )

console.log(event.target) : this is going to give the element itself

The way to implement One-Way-Data-Flow :
We take data of message then we want to change it so we then grap the new change event we then set it to a new variable (newMessage)
here we're just mutating the values as soon as we're given them by take the copy of those values and reflect those changes 

One of the benefits of not mutating the original values we could've a button such as reset we could click that button and can reset the 
text back to its original state 

Lec : 08-template-reference-variables

It allows us to grab or holdup an element or a component and access some further information about it 
#ref : template ref gives us an access to the particular dom element essentially exports the property so 
we can access anywhere in our template using the # variable

here we're not dealing with dollar event anymore 
So essentially template-reference-variables differs where you want to use it here we're using template-reference-variables for an
input element and we get that root DOM element back
